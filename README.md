Gatekeeper is an important service that allows clients to interact with other services without the need to manage them directly.

The Gatekeeper composition includes controllers that enable the management of users, folders, and files. Additionally, the API Gateway provides a unified interface for interacting with microservices while hiding the details of their implementation from the end user.

This simplifies client logic and reduces the number of requests to various services.

If you want to learn more about the requests implemented in the service, you can read the [Wiki](https://github.com/Practice-ISU/gatekeeper/wiki).
